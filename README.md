# 🏠 House Price Prediction Model

This project was developed during my **Machine Learning Internship at NovaNector Services Pvt. Ltd.** The goal was to build a real-time predictive system that can process over **1 million records per day** and accurately estimate housing prices based on various features.

## 📌 Project Overview

The system uses machine learning algorithms such as **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** to predict house prices based on:

- Location
- Area (in sq. ft.)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Amenities
- Construction type and year

## 🚀 Highlights

- 📊 Trained on large-scale real estate datasets
- 🧹 Performed data cleaning, outlier removal, and feature engineering
- 🎯 Achieved high accuracy using model tuning and cross-validation
- 🌐 Integrated predictions with a user-friendly web interface
- ⚡ Reduced training time by 50% using optimized pipelines

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Flask (for deployment)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)

## 📈 Future Scope

- Integration with live real estate APIs
- Enhancing model performance with deep learning
- Making it available as a web service or mobile app

## 🙌 Acknowledgment

Special thanks to **NovaNector Pvt. Ltd.** for the mentorship and the opportunity to work on this impactful project.
